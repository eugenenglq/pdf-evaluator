# API Gateway Streaming Response Solution

## Problem

The application was attempting to use streaming responses from Amazon Bedrock through API Gateway, but standard REST API Gateway doesn't support streaming responses natively.

## Solution

We've modified the Lambda function (`backend/lambda/process-image-bedrock/app.py`) to collect all streamed chunks from Bedrock and return a complete response instead of attempting to stream the response through API Gateway.

### Changes made:

1. Instead of formatting each chunk as a server-sent event and returning a streaming response:
   ```python
   # Before
   response_body = ""
   for event in response_stream:
       # Processing logic...
       response_body += f"data: {json.dumps({'chunk': text_chunk})}\n\n"
   
   # End the stream with a final event
   response_body += "data: {\"done\": true}\n\n"
   
   # Return the streaming response
   return {
       'statusCode': 200,
       'headers': streaming_headers,
       'body': response_body,
       'isBase64Encoded': False
   }
   ```

2. We now accumulate all chunks into a complete response:
   ```python
   # After
   full_response = ""
   for event in response_stream:
       # Processing logic...
       full_response += text_chunk
   
   # Return the complete response (non-streaming)
   return {
       'statusCode': 200,
       'headers': headers,
       'body': json.dumps({'response': full_response}),
       'isBase64Encoded': False
   }
   ```

### Why This Works

This solution works because:
1. We still benefit from the streaming capabilities of Bedrock within the Lambda function
2. The frontend already expects a response with `data.response` format
3. We avoid trying to stream responses through API Gateway, which doesn't natively support it

### Alternative Solutions (Not Implemented)

If true streaming is required in the future, you could consider:

1. **WebSockets**: Using API Gateway WebSocket APIs to establish a bidirectional connection
2. **HTTP/2 Streaming**: Using HTTP/2 streaming with API Gateway HTTP APIs (not REST APIs)
3. **Direct SDK Integration**: Have the frontend call Bedrock directly with appropriate IAM permissions

These alternatives would require more significant architectural changes to implement.
